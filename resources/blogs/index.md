# Blogs
It would be impossible to list all the great security blogs out there, but here are some of my favs:

G0tmi1k
-----
Ah, so much good stuff [here](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/), but I know the [Basic Linux Privesc Cheatsheet](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) saved my bacon on more than one occasion!  

Graceful Security
-----
I only found [this site](https://www.gracefulsecurity.com/gracefulsecurity/) recently, but it has a whole bunch of great articles, particularly on SQL injection, SQLMap and Burp usage.

Hacker News
-----
[This](http://thehackernews.com) should be on your daily/weekly reading list for sure.  THN covers a lot of tech security stories, a lot of which focuses on mobile security.

HaveIBeenPwned
-----
I'd submit any email address you use to the [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com) database to see if that address - or your domain - has been associated with any data leaks and/or breaches.

KrebsOnSecurity
-----
A must read for the [latest infosec news](http://krebsonsecurity.com), plus a ton of great technical advice as well on securing your PC, browser, wifi and more.

TroyHunt.com
-----
Troy [blogs](https://troyhunt.com) a lot about security news, breaches, and Web security in general. He's also the creator of [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com).
