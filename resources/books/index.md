I barely read anything that's not displayed on a screen, but when I *do*...

## [The Hacker Playbook](http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1494932636) 
I think if you've taken OSCP, this book would be a great next step for working on successful pentests.  I dedicated a whole [podcast episode](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/34.mp3') to the book.

## [The Hacker Playbook 2](http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1512214566)
I didn't do a whole episode on it, but scooped it up as soon as it was available.  It was updated to include many more practical examples, particularly to answer one of my burning questions: "What the heck do you do when you're on a network with no creds?  What should some of your first steps be?!"

## [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914)
I'm working through this in 2017 and so far really enjoying it.  Don't let the title scare you off - the "hard way" implies that you won't be just copying/pasting exercises and tearing through the book high speed.  You'll need to go slow and potentially do similar exercises several times - but that's all in the name of gaining a deep understanding of Python.

## [Penetration Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641)
I found this book to be an extremely well-rounded guide to introduce you to hacking.  A wide scope of topics are covered - everything from scoping the pentest to finding/exploiting targets and developing exploits.  This, paired with the Web Application Hacker's Handbook (below) would be a great one-two punch of knowledge to introduce you to a wide variety of hacking tools and techniques. 

## [Python Crash Course](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) 
This book is *exactly* what it claims to be: "a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming."  I'm banging through it whenever I get a few moments, and love it so far.  Here's a [podcast episode](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/137.mp3).


## [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470)
Are you interested in getting better with Burp and Webapp pentesting?  Just get this book.  Enough said.  :D
