I barely read anything that's not displayed on a screen, but when I *do*...

The Hacker Playbook
-----
I think if you've taken OSCP, [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1494932636) would be a great next step for working on successful pentests.  I dedicated a whole [podcast episode](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/34.mp3') to the book.

The Hacker Playbook 2
-----
I didn't do a whole episode on [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1512214566), but scooped it up as soon as it was available.  It was updated to include many more practical examples, particularly to answer one of my burning questions: "What the heck do you do when you're on a network with no creds?  What should some of your first steps be?!"

Learn Python the Hard Way
-----
I'm working through [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914) in 2017 and so far really enjoying it.  Don't let the title scare you off - the "hard way" implies that you won't be just copying/pasting exercises and tearing through the book high speed.  You'll need to go slow and potentially do similar exercises several times - but that's all in the name of gaining a deep understanding of Python.

Penetration Testing
-----
I found [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641) to be an extremely well-rounded guide to introduce you to hacking.  A wide scope of topics are covered - everything from scoping the pentest to finding/exploiting targets and developing exploits.  This, paired with the Web Application Hacker's Handbook (below) would be a great one-two punch of knowledge to introduce you to a wide variety of hacking tools and techniques.

Python Crash Course
-----
[This book](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) is *exactly* what it claims to be: "a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming."  I'm banging through it whenever I get a few moments, and love it so far.  Here's a [podcast episode](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/137.mp3).

Pwning OWASP Juice Shop
-----
This is the "[Official companion guide](https://leanpub.com/juice-shop) to the OWASP Juice Shop" - get it now!  The price is free, but you should definitely pitch in to thank [Bj√∂rn Kimminich](https://leanpub.com/u/bkimminich) for all his hard work!

The Web Application Hacker's Handbook
-----
Are you interested in getting better with Burp and Webapp pentesting?  Just get [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470).  Enough said.  :D
