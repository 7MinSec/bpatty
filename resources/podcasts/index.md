# FIX ME!

# Podcasts
Podcasts seem to be like opinions (everybody's got one!) but here are some of the ones in my roll:

7 Minute Security
------
[7 Minute Security](http://7ms.us) - I heard it's pretty ok ;-)


Building a Life and Career in Information Security
------
[Building a Life and Career in Information Security](http://jayschulman.com) features advice on learning and growing your infosec career.  I was featured in an episode in May, 2016 which you can [listen to here](https://www.jayschulman.com/brian-johnson/).

Mohr Stories with Jay Mohr
-------
[Mohr Stories with Jay Mohr](http://www.jaymohr.com) has *nothing* to do with infosec but I love the way he conducts interviews with celebs.  He doesn't just pander to them and stroke their egos - he gets to know them as real people, and thus we as the listeners do too.

Security Now
------
[Security Now](https://twit.tv/sn) features Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte slicing and dicing the week's tech news.  It's a long show, but chock full of good info - especially if you enjoy taking deep dives into heavy tech explanations of network vulns and technologies.

Security Weekly
------
[Security Weekly](https://securityweekly.com) does a great job of covering the week's infosec news - often with a sarcastic (and sometimes inebriated :-) twist.

Ten Minute Podcast
[Ten Minute Podcast](http://tenminutepodcast.com) has friggin' *nothing* to do with infosec but is actually one of the big reasons I decided to do 7MS.  In its short 10-minute format, comedian/actor Will Sasso (and his pals) do comedy bits and stories, think of screenplay ideas, and let listeners Skype in to share what's in their fridge.  

Tradecraft Security Weekly
------
[Tradecraft Security Weekly](https://securityweekly.com/category/tsw/) is awesome!  [Beau Bullock](https://twitter.com/dafthack) and friends show pentesting tips and tricks in short podcast episodes.  Love it!

Brakeing Down Security
-----
[Brakeing Down Security Podcast](http://www.brakeingsecurity.com/) has some great, practical advice on a wide variety of security topics.
