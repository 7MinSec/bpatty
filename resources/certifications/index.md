CEH
------
Well, I gotta be honest and say I think the [CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)](https://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker) is becoming more and more outdated.  I took it ~December 2013, and while I did pick up a few good tidbits, it provided little to no *actual* hacking.  

I did a review of the training [here](https://7ms.us/review-certified-ethical-hacker-training/), an exam study guide [here](https://7ms.us/7ms-17-how-to-pass-the-certified-ethical-hacker/), and also some things to consider if you're trying to decide whether to go for the [OSCP vs. CEH](https://7ms.us/episodeguide-featured/#ceh).  

OSCP
-------
Well, I can't really say enough great things about [OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/).  It is pretty much the only training I've seen that offers near 100% hands-on learning if you want to be an ethical hacker/pentester.  I did a nine-part podcast series on my experience with the training, which you can read more about - and listen to - in my [episode guide](https://7ms.us/episodeguide-featured/#oscp).

OSWP
-------
The [OSWP (Offensive Security Wireless Professional)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oswp-offensive-security-wireless-professional/) is Offensive Security's wireless security training offering.  I learned a ton, and the exam proved to be a fun challenge as well.  Check out [this section](https://7ms.us/episodeguide-featured/#oswp) of my 7 Minute Security episode guide for more info, which features a 4-part audio series on my experience with the training and test.
