# CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
Well, I gotta be honest and say I think [this material](https://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker) is becoming more and more outdated.  I took it ~December 2013, and while I did pick up a few good tidbits, it provided little to no *actual* hacking.  

I did a review of the training [here](https://7ms.us/review-certified-ethical-hacker-training/), an exam study guide [here](https://7ms.us/7ms-17-how-to-pass-the-certified-ethical-hacker/), and also some things to consider if you're trying to decide whether to go for the [OSCP vs. CEH](https://7ms.us/episodeguide-featured/#ceh).
