# Programming and Scripting
This is one area I'm looking to beef my skills up in, so below are some good resources.  Also, check out my [books](../books.md) page for more ideas.

## General

### Secure coding
This [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/course/secure-coding/#) course looks like an awesome - and free! - way to "Learn about XSS, direct object reference, data exposure, buffer overflows, & resource management."

## Language-specific
### .Net
* [Creating simple .Net applications in Windows, Linux and Mac](https://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/briacht)

### PowerShell
* See my [PowerShell](../../scripts/windows/powershell.md) page for some quick ref kind of stuff.

* [PowerShell for DFIR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbotSZeFkQ&feature=youtu.be) looks like an awesome series brought to us by [@brakesec](https://twitter.com/brakesec).

* [UnderTheWire.tech](http://www.underthewire.tech/) is a cool site to help people "...use Windows PowerShell in a variety of situations through innovative and fun wargames."

### Python

#### Codecademy
I'm currently going through the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/2?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) intro to Python course and it's great.  They give you a compiler and everything else you need right in the Web interface.


#### Hackernews.com deal
If you're looking to learn Python for hacking purposes, [this course](http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/learn-python-hacking.html?m=1) looks promising for ~$20-30.

#### PluralSight
I'm working through the "Introduction to Python Fundamentals" [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/python-fundamentals) and so far it's pretty solid!
