# Hacking
Looking to sharpen those hacking skills in a safe/legal environment?  Kudos!  Here are some places to do just that:

## Computer Hacker Professional Certification Package
I found this one on [The Hacker News](http://thehackernews.com/2017/01/hacking-training-course.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheHackersNews+%28The+Hackers+News+-+Security+Blog%29).  Not sure on the quality, but $60 for a course designed to help you pass the following certs is pretty attractive:

* Ethical Hacker Certification Exams
* Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
* Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)
* Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)
* Forensics Investigator Certification Exams

## Damn Vulnerable Web Sockets
This [vulnerable Web application](https://github.com/interference-security/DVWS) "which works on web sockets for client-server communication."

## Hack and Defend Your Web Site
This is [the first course](http://course.hyperiongray.com/vcourse/) I ever took on Web app hacking and I *loved* it.  Good news for you is now it's free and covers setting up Burp, performing SQL injections, sqlmap, XSS and more!

## Hackazon
This is a [Rapid 7 project](https://github.com/rapid7/hackazon) project and is "a free, vulnerable test site that is an online storefront built with the same technologies used in todayâ€™s rich client and mobile applications."

## HackTheBox
[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/en) is an "online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills."  To even participate in hacking the virtual resource the site provides, you have to pass a hacking test :-)

## Pentest.training
[Pentest.training](https://pentest.training/) is "a simple website used as a hub for information revolving around the varies services we offer to help both experienced and new penetration testers practice and hone their skills."

## Pwn_Lab
[Pwn_Lab](https://github.com/ztgrace/pwn_lab) is "collection of Vagrant scripts and boxes to create security training environments."

## UnderTheWire
[UnderTheWire](http://www.underthewire.tech/) aims to train "experienced, developing, and novice Information Technologists to use Windows PowerShell in a variety of situations through innovative and fun wargames." 

## Vulnhub
[Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)'s goal is "...to provide materials that allows anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration."  There are tons of VMs to download and hack away on, and the difficulty ranges from "newb/novice" to "OMG!"

Some of my favorites include:

* [Droopy CTF](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/droopy-v02,143/)
* [FristiLeaks](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/fristileaks-13,133/)
* [Kevgir](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kevgir-1,137/)
* [Lord of the Root](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/lord-of-the-root-101,129/)
* [Milnet](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/milnet-1,148/)
* [Skydog](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/skydog-1,142/)

* [Simple](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sectalks-bne0x03-simple,141/)
* [Stapler](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/)

And in a bit of shameless self-promotion, I must plug my own VMs:

* [Tommy Boy](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tommy-boy-1,157/)
