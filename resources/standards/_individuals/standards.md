# Standards
Here's a starting page with some info on standards that we as security folks need to be informed about:

## Critical Security Controls

I started plopping this stuff into [its own page](critical_security_controls.md).

## NIST CSF (Cyber Security Framework)
* Tenable has a [nice article](https://www.tenable.com/blog/understanding-nist-s-cybersecurity-framework) on the framework
* Rapid 7 has one too, also featuring [a video](https://www.rapid7.com/resources/nist-cybersecurity-framework-explained/)
* FRSecure has a [blog article](https://frsecure.com/blog/how-to-use-and-not-use-the-nist-csf/) on how to use (and not use) the framework

## PCI
I found that [this site](http://blog.securitymetrics.com/2016/10/how-do-merchant-levels-determine-pci.html) does a nice job of understanding PCI merchant levels, when it's necessary to get a QSA involved, etc.
