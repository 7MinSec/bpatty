# Podcasts
Podcasts seem to be like opinions (everybody's got one!) but here are some of the ones in my roll:

## [7 Minute Security](http://7ms.us)
I heard it's pretty ok ;-)

## [Building a Life and Career in Information Security](http://jayschulman.com) 
This podcast features advice on learning and growing your infosec career.  I was featured in an episode in May, 2016 which you can [listen to here](https://www.jayschulman.com/brian-johnson/).

## [Mohr Stories with Jay Mohr](http://www.jaymohr.com) 
Well, it has *nothing* to do with infosec but I love the way he conducts interviews with celebs.  He doesn't just pander to them and stroke their egos - he gets to know them as real people, and thus we as the listeners do too.

## [Security Now](https://twit.tv/sn)
This show features Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte slicing and dicing the week's tech news.  It's a long show, but chock full of good info - especially if you enjoy taking deep dives into heavy tech explanations of network vulns and technologies.

## [Security Weekly](https://securityweekly.com) 
The Security Weekly does a great job of covering the week's infosec news - often with a sarcastic (and sometimes inebriated :-) twist.

## [Ten Minute Podcast](http://tenminutepodcast.com)
This one has friggin' *nothing* to do with infosec but is actually one of the big reasons I decided to do 7MS.  In its short 10-minute format, comedian/actor Will Sasso (and his pals) do comedy bits and stories, think of screenplay ideas, and let listeners Skype in to share what's in their fridge.
