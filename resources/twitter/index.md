Here's a snippet of people I follow on Twitter whose accounts are full of delicious infosec info:

Is like ettercap, but **better**!  I did a video demo of Bettercap [here](https://7ms.us/7ms-228-fun-with-bettercap/) if you want to see it in action.

[Brutalsecrets](https://twitter.com/brutalsecrets)

Has awesome tips on Web hacking, specifically XSS.  Note: this is a protected account you need to pay access to read.  But with that payment you also get access to [Knoxss](http://knoxss.me).  I found Brute's advice to be awesome, and he's personally helped me on a few pentest engagements where I got stuck.

He's got excellent Powershell tips and advice - specifically about the great Empire tool.

This account provides updates on data leaks/breaches.  Nice to monitor so you can quickly change your password.  Sometimes HIBP sends notification about breaches before the vendors do!

ISJ sarcastically says everything we *want* to say to C-level peeps about infosec, but are afraid to :-)
