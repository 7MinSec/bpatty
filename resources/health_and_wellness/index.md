# Health and Wellness
Lets face it.  As IT/infosec people, we don't always take care of ourselves first.  We finish the pentest, root the box, exploit the XSS, etc. *first* and worry about us later.  Here are some articles, ideas and apps to help keep your body healthy so you can keep pwning!

## Apps

### 10% Happier
Honestly I've not been much of a believer in the whole meditation thing (for me, when my eyes close, I go to sleep for at least an hour).  *But* I just started following the short sessions on this [app](http://www.10percenthappier.com/) and I gotta say, the meditation skeptic in me is diminishing.

### LoseIt
This [app](https://www.loseit.com/) is a slick way to track your food/calories/exercise, set weight loss goals, etc.  It's free (a premium version is available), easy to use, has a jillion foods pre-programmed in it, and you also have the option to snap a pic of a food's barcode if Lose-It doesn't know about it.
