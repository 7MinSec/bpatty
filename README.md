#**B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou

##I just want go get started!
Ok, no problem - just start with the [index](index.md).

##OK I'm slightly intrigued and/or confused.  What is this?
**B.P.A.T.T.Y.** (**B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou) is my collection of tips, tricks and scripts that I used to save in OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/bpatty) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a github repository makes more sense.  So here we are!

##What are the pre-requisites?
* **Patience** (*required*) - I'm writing a lot of this stuff fast and then smoothing it out later, so I may have broken links and errors sometimes.  If you see something needing correction, please [say something](https://7ms.us/contact).

* **A Markdown viewer/editor** (*optional*) because I wrote most of this in [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).  [This site](https://www.maketecheasier.com/markdown-editors-linux/) lists some options if you need ideas.

##Wait, wait! There are already way, way, WAY better documents, tools and collections like this out there!
My response (substitute "microphone" for "documentation project"): [https://youtu.be/C_SFevIz1FI?t=14](https://youtu.be/C_SFevIz1FI?t=14).

##How often does BPATTY get updated?
In my dream situation: every 1-2 weeks.  In reality: every month.

##Who are you?
Hi, I'm [Brian](http://brianjohnson.tv) and I blog/podcast about information security at [7 Minute Security](https://7ms.us).
