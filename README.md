#**B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou

**BPATTY** is my collection of tips, tricks and scripts that I used to save in OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/bpatty) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a github repository makes more sense.

#Pre-requisites
* **A Markdown viewer/editor** (*optional*) because I wrote most of this in [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).  [This site](https://www.maketecheasier.com/markdown-editors-linux/) lists some options if you need ideas.


#FAQ:

##Wait, wait! There's already way better tools and collections like this out there!
Ok.

##OMg, based on your activity it's clear you're a super newb to GitHub and have NO idea what you're doing!!!
Correct.  I *just* learned about the whole branch/push/pull thing...I'll stop putting so much stuff right in the master branch all the time.  But I'm new to this so BACK OFF OK?!  ;-)

##So...who the H are you?
Hi, I'm [Brian](http://brianjohnson.tv) and I blog/podcast about security at [7 Minute Security](https://7ms.us).
