##What the H is this?

It's my collection of tips, tricks and scripts that I used to save in OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/bpatty) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a github repository makes more sense.

##Wait, wait! There's already way better tools and collections like this out there!
Ok.

##OMg, based on your activity it's clear you're a super newb to GitHub and have NO idea what you're doing
Correct.

##So...who the H are you?
Hi, I'm Brian.
