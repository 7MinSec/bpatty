#**B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou v.0001

##What is this?
**B.P.A.T.T.Y.** (**B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou) is my collection of tips, tricks and scripts that I used to save in OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/bpatty) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a github repository makes more sense.

##What are the pre-requisites?
* **Patience** (*required*) - I'm writing a lot of this stuff fast and then smoothing it out later, so I may have broken links and stuff until I get *everything* moved over.  When this readme.md boasts version 1.0 that means I feel pretty good that all the navigation-y thingies are working and the writing quality is slightly better then that of a fourth grader.  I *almost* wrote "forth grader" just then.  That's how sharp of a tack I am.

* **A Markdown viewer/editor** (*optional*) because I wrote most of this in [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).  [This site](https://www.maketecheasier.com/markdown-editors-linux/) lists some options if you need ideas.

##Wait, wait! There's already way, way, WAY better documents, tools and collections like this out there!
But none written by *me* so hah!  And please watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_SFevIz1FI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_SFevIz1FI).

##OMg, based on your activity it's clear you're a super newb to GitHub and have NO idea what you're doing!!!
Correct. 

##Who are you?
