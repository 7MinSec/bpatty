pingythingy.sh
-------
[This script](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/mac/pingythingy.sh) is a quick dumb script I threw together to keep tabs on how terrible my ISP's connection was to the Internet.  Basically the script does a continual ping to an IP of your choice and logs the results to a text file.
