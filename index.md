Welcome to BPATTY!
==================

> This is **BPATTY**, which stands for **B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou.  It's basically my collection of tech/security tips, tricks and scripts that once upon a time I saved to OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  
> 
> I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a Github repository and Wiki makes more sense.  So here we are!
> 
> I sincerely hope BPATTY can help you in your IT and infosec journey.  If you have any suggestions/edits for BPATTY contact, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/braimee/bpatty/issues) and I'll respond!

Wait, wait! There are already way, way, WAY better documents, tools and collections like this out there!

My response (substitute "microphone" for "documentation project") is [this](https://youtu.be/C_SFevIz1FI?t=14).

How often does BPATTY get updated?
--------
In my dream situation: every 1-2 weeks.  In reality: when I get to it.

Who are you?
--------
Hi, I'm [Brian](http://brianjohnson.tv) and I blog/podcast about information security at [7 Minute Security](https://7ms.us).

I want to electronically punch you in the neck!
--------
Head to the [7MS Slack channel](https://slackpass.io/7minsec) and punch away!

I like what you're doing with this whole 7 Minute Security thing. How can I support these efforts?
