What in the world is a "BPATTY?!"
--------

This is **BPATTY**, which stands for **B**rian's **P**entesting **a**nd **T**echnical **T**ips for **Y**ou.  It's basically my collection of tech/security tips, tricks and scripts that once upon a time I saved to OneNote, Evernote, Notepad, Stickies, Notepad++, Dropbox Paper...*deep breath*...Leafpad, Post-it notes, etc.  

I made a big effort last year to throw all this crud in one place on [my blog](https://7ms.us/) but realized that for people (especially me) to actually *use* it, a Github repository and Wiki makes more sense.  So here we are!

I sincerely hope BPATTY can help you in your IT and infosec journey.  If you have any suggestions/edits for BPATTY contact, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/braimee/bpatty/issues) and I'll respond!

Any similarities to a "beef" patty?
--------
Just in that they are both delicious and not necessarily healthy for you.


Wait, wait! There are already way, way, WAY better documents, tools and collections like this out there!

My response (substitute "microphone" for "documentation project") is [this](https://youtu.be/C_SFevIz1FI?t=14).

How often does BPATTY get updated?
--------
Not as often as I'd like.  But check out the [change log](https://github.com/braimee/bpatty/blob/master/_CHANGELOG.md) if you want to keep tabs on things.

Who are you?
