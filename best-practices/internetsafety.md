#Internet Safety
Here are some general tips I've assembled and sent out in various bits and pieces to friends, families, and enemies.  Wait, not enemies, but the first two.

##Web browsing
* **Which Web browser to use?**
 * For non-techies: I recommend Chrome.  It will keep itself updated (I've seen instances where something (malware?) on a machine prevented Firefox from notifying about updates and the version has gotten stale - and thus vulnerable.
 * For everybody else: Chrome or Firefox.
 * For NOBODY: Internet Explorer or Edge.

* **Email**
 * Don't click on links.  
 * Don't open attachments.
 * Don't click on links.
 * Don't open attachments.
 * Don't reply to junk mail and ask them to "take you off their list."  This just confirms you're a real living, breathing person who is checking mail actively.

* **Passwords**
 * Use a long (whatever the maximum number of characters allowed is) password that is *unique* for each and every site you use. 
 * Don't use any combination of these for your password:
  * Birthday
  * First name
  * Last name 
 * Use a password vault like [LastPass](http://lastpass.com) or [1Password](http://1password.com) to manage these gnarly passwords.

 ###Sections to add/update
 * Finish password area, fix nested lists
 *
