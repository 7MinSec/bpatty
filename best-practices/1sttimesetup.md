#1st time setup for a PC/Mac
Whenever I get a new machine, here are some general things I do to update/secure it:

* Download and install all latest OS/app updates, then set things to auto-patch wherever possible
* Change screen saver to *Require password* when activated (see System Preferences -> Security & Privacy on the Mac side, Control Panel-->Personalization on the PC)
* Use Firefox or Chrome as primary browser and install:
 * uBlock Origin
 * LastPass plugin
* Install these apps:
 * [ProXPN](http://proxpn.me) when connected to any wifi but my own
 * VMWare/VirtualBox/etc - for any research or testing where I am even 1% suspicious I'll get bit by malware, I install a fully updated VM and snapshot it. When research is over I revert to golden VM
 * Firewall - [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) for Mac, [Glasswire](https://www.glasswire.com/) for PC.  I did a podcast episode on Glasswire [here](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/89.mp3)
 * Antivirus/antimalware - I don't currently run anything on the Mac, but regularly scan my PCs with [MalwareBytes](http://malwarebytes.com) products
* *Don't* install (or uninstall *or* enable [click to play](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/help-keep-threats-at-bay-with-click-to-play/)) these things:
  * Flash (see [Krebs article](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/why-you-should-ditch-adobe-shockwave/) on this)
  * Java (see [Krebs article](http://krebsonsecurity.com/how-to-unplug-java-from-the-browser/) on this)
* Encrypt hard drive (FileVault for Mac, Bitlocker for PC)
* Put tape over the Webcam
* Backup your stuff! I like [CrashPlan](http://www.crashplan.com) and did a podcast episode on it [here](https://media.zencast.fm/embed/7-minute-security-podcast-podcast/27.mp3).
