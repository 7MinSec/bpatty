# Nessus

## Install Lets Encrypt certificate on Nessus
Make sure your Lets Encrypt cert is [already generated](https://certbot.eff.org/) and available in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/F.Q.D.N` folder.  

Stop Nessus with `/etc/init.d/nessusd stop`

Use the following script (thank you [http://bbouille.github.io/2016/02/23/letsencrypt-for-nessus/](http://bbouille.github.io/2016/02/23/letsencrypt-for-nessus/)!!!) to copy the necessary cert files over:

    sudo cp -i /etc/letsencrypt/live/THE.FQDN.OF-YOUR.SERVER/fullchain.pem /opt/nessus/com/nessus/CA/servercert.pem
    sudo cp -i /etc/letsencrypt/live/THE.FQDN.OF-YOUR.SERVER/privkey.pem /opt/nessus/var/nessus/CA/serverkey.pem
    sudo cp -i /etc/letsencrypt/live/THE.FQDN.OF-YOUR.SERVER/chain.pem /opt/nessus/com/nessus/CA/cacert.pem

Start Nessus with `/etc/init.d/nessusd start`

That's it!  BAM!

## Parsing/combining raw .nessus files
Many times I break my Nessus scans up into smaller chunks - such as by site - so that the load on the network is a bit more focused.  However, at the end of the day it's a pain to try to combine these into a single .csv manually.  Fortunately, [Yet Another Nessus Parser](https://github.com/adipinto/yet-another-nessus-parser) makes that a snap!  Just get all the .nessus files into a folder, such as `/combine` and then run:

`/opt/yanp/yanp.py -i /combine --csv /wherever/I/want/to/save/the/big.csv`
