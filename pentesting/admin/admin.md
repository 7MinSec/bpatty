##What to do when pentesting in a vacuum (no or little Internet access)
* Listen to episodes #158, #164 and #170 of the [7 Minute Security](http://bit.ly/7minsec) podcast :-)
* Whitelist just the necessary http/https URLs to allow Kali to reach out to the 'net for OS updates, Metasploit definitions, and tools:
  * http.kali.org
  * dl.google.com
  * github.com
  * openvas.org
  * security.kali.org
