# Red Team Resources
Here are some blogs/wikis/etc. with good red team learning goodies to behold:

## Hunting on the Cheap
[Endgame](https://www.endgame.com/blog/technical-blog/hunting-cheap-part-1-architecture) has a great blog series on hunting for threats without investing huge wads of $$$.

## Red Team Infrastructure Wiki
Man, a resource like [this wiki](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Wiki) make me want to do more advanced red team engagements.  It has some really thorough explanations, pics, walkthroughs, etc. about building a flexible and resilient red team infrastructure.
