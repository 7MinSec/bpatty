# Red Team
Here are some blogs/wikis/etc. with good red team learning goodies to behold:

### Hunting on the Cheap
[Endgame](https://www.endgame.com/blog/technical-blog/hunting-cheap-part-1-architecture) has a great blog series on hunting for threats without investing huge wads of $$$.

### Open Source Pentesting/Red Teaming
[Mubix](http://room362.com) posted a great bundle of slides/talk/files/etc. at the [Wild West Hackin' Fest](https://wildwesthackinfest.com) all about [open source pentesting/red teaming](https://bit.ly/OpenSourcePentest).  Here's a direct [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByiDshWJ_PnZdnJZQ0h3MWZyRUk?usp=sharing) to all the goods he's creating.  Looks awesome!

### Red Team Infrastructure Wiki
Man, a resource like [this wiki](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Wiki) make me want to do more advanced red team engagements.  It has some really thorough explanations, pics, walkthroughs, etc. about building a flexible and resilient red team infrastructure.
