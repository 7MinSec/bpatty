#Vulnerability Databases
Scanners like [Nessus](pentesting/vulnerability-scanners/nessus.md) and [OpenVAS](pentesting/vulnerability-scanners/openvas.md) have enormous databases of vulnerabilities built right in.  However, it's still good to check some online resources for exploits you see in those hard-to-reach places.

* [ExploitDB](http://exploit-db.com) -  hosted by the fine folks at OffSec and is pretty much the go-to vulnerability database for pentesters.  Tip: using [Searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit/) makes it *extra* easy to find the vulns you're looking for!

* [Joomla](http://joomla.or) keeps a database of [known vulnerabilities](https://vel.joomla.org/live-vel) continually up to date.

* [SecurityFocus](http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities) - has vuln write-ups as well as white papers, blogs and tech articles.

* [Web Hacking Incident Database (WHID)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZPAw1uCdLqDz8F_Vz57DRvCNJTcCnPgtG7P-yeloUc/edit#gid=1) - appears to be outdated or not maintained anymore?

* [WPVulndb.com](https://wpvulndb.com/) - a large collection of Wordpress core, plugin and theme vulnerabilities.
