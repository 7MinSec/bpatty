# Openvas
Offensive has a good [primer article on getting Openvas setup in Kali](https://www.kali.org/penetration-testing/openvas-vulnerability-scanning/).  Basically the key commands are:

`apt-get update`
`apt-get dist-upgrade`
`apt-get install openvas`
`openvas-setup`

Pay close attention to the end of the setup - an admin pw will be generate for you!  If you missed that or need to reset admin pw:

`sudo openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=THENEWPASSWORD`

Then open https://YOUR.LOCAL.IP.ADDRESS:9392, and you should be good to freakin' go!
