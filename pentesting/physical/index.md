Lockpicking
--------
I'm just getting started with this as of 9/28/17 and going to track progress and resources here.

### Equipment
People say a lot of good things about the [Sparrows lock picks](http://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/), specifically the [Night School](http://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/nightschooltux.htm) set.  Personally I've got this [Southord PXS-14](https://www.southord.com/Lock-Pick-Tools/Lock-Pick-Set-14-Piece-PXS-14.html) set.

### Training
* I'm starting by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjuT_63Ioig)

* This one's good too: [How to pick a lock (a beginner's guide)](https://art-of-lockpicking.com/how-to-pick-a-lock-guide/)
