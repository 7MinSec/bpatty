# Build your own pentest lab!

Hey, if you've been looking to build your own pentest lab, I've got a series (start [here](https://7ms.us/7ms-224-diy-500-pentesting-lab-part-1/)) that will help you get setup.  Once you're up and running, some of the files in this folder will help you setup a pentest environment:

* [lusers.csv](lusers.csv) - a list of test `lusers` you can import into your AD Domain Controller (be sure to make the info match your environment before import!) 
* [import-ad-users.ps1](import-ad-users.ps1) - this will import the `lusers.csv` into your AD environment

Here are some other good resources to help you out:
