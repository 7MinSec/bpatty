# Defense/Hardening
I thought I'd start a page with resources focused on *defending* against the common weaknesses we find during penetration testing.  My hope is this page could be something we send to customers after (or even before!) a pentest to help them take actionable steps in boosting their network defenses.

## Active Directory
* [Securing domain controllers](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3377) is a great first step in slowing down AD-focused attacks.

* [Creating strong passwords](http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?p=5460) is relatively easy (if not painful for the end user) by following this guide from BHIS.

* [Anti-Reconnaissance Tool: SAMRi10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-researchers-release-anti-reconnaissance-tool-named-samri10/) is something Microsoft announced in December, 2016 and is used to limit who can perform SAMR queries for information on users within the same domain.

* [Microsoft's Advanced Threat Analytics](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ATA-Playbook-ef0a8e38) playbook "turns Active Directory into a powerful post-infiltration detection tool leveraging both signature and user-and-entity-behavioral analytic techniques..."

* [IISCrypto](https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto) is not really a defense tool per se, but is a slick GUI tool that gives "administrators the ability to enable or disable protocols, ciphers, hashes and key exchange algorithms on Windows Server 2008, 2012 and 2016. It also lets you reorder SSL/TLS cipher suites offered by IIS, implement best practices with a single click, create custom templates and test your website."

## Linux
* [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/download/lynis/) is "a security auditing tool for UNIX derivatives like Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, AIX, and others. It performs an in-depth security scan."

* [20 Linux Server Hardening Tips](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html) offers exactly what it advertises! :-)

## Network
* [Blocking local networking hijacking attacks](https://www.root9b.com/newsroom/blocking-local-network-hijacking-attacks) such as WPAD, Netbios, LLMNR, etc.

* [Auditing and restricting NTLM usage guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj865674(v=ws.10).aspx)
