#Defense/Hardening
I thought I'd start a page with resources focused on *defending* against the common weaknesses we find during penetration testing.  My hope is this page could be something we send to customers after (or even before!) a pentest to help them take actionable steps in boosting their network defenses.

##Active Directory
* [Securing domain controllers](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3377) is a great first step in slowing down AD-focused attacks.

* [Creating strong passwords](http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?p=5460) is relatively easy (if not painful for the end user) by following this guide from BHIS.

* [Anti-Reconnaissance Tool: SAMRi10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-researchers-release-anti-reconnaissance-tool-named-samri10/) is something Microsoft announced in December, 2016 and is used to limit who can perform SAMR queries for information on users within the same domain.

##Linux
* [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/download/lynis/) is "a security auditing tool for UNIX derivatives like Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, AIX, and others. It performs an in-depth security scan."

* [20 Linux Server Hardening Tips](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html) offers exactly what it advertises! :-)

##Network
* [Blocking local networking hijacking attacks](https://www.root9b.com/newsroom/blocking-local-network-hijacking-attacks) such as WPAD, Netbios, LLMNR, etc.
