#Bloodhound
[Bloodhound](https://github.com/adaptivethreat/BloodHound), according to GitHub "uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.

##Quick start guide using Kali

###Clone Bloodhound repository     
    git clone https://github.com/adaptivethreat/BloodHound /opt/bloodhound
   
###Install Neo4j

Go to [https://neo4j.com/](https://neo4j.com/) and download/extract the Linux package.

###Download and extract the Bloodhound binaries
Grab the one that's right for your environment [here](https://github.com/adaptivethreat/BloodHound/releases).

###Copy the Bloodhound database over the sample neo4j one

    cp -r /path-to-bloodhound/BloodHoundExampleDB.graphdb /path-to-neo4j/data/databases/sample.
    
###Login to Neo4j portal and change the password

From the `/path-to-neo4j/` run this:

    neo4j console  

You'll be given a Web URL to visit.  Upon opening it you'll be prompted to change the password from `neo4j` to something else.  Do it.  :-)

###Run Bloodhound

Now, go to the `/path-you-extracted-bloodhound-binaries-to/` and run `./Bloodhound`

Once the Bloodhound [interface](https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Bloodhound/wiki/Interface-Intro) is open, you'll provide a URL of `http://localhost:7474`, a DB Username of `neo4j` and a password of `yournewpassword`

###Collect data to slurp into Bloodhound
There are many ways to do this, but what I did is uploaded [BloodHound.ps1](https://github.com/adaptivethreat/BloodHound/tree/master/PowerShell) to a temp folder on my target, then ran these PS commands:

    import-module BloodHound.ps1
    Get-BloodHoundData | Export-BloodHoundCSV
    
This dumped a handful of .csv files to the folder that `BloodHound.ps1` was in.  I downloaded those via my Empire agent using `download blah.csv` `download blah2.csv` etc. and then those files get stored in `path/to/empire/downloads/NAME-OF-AGENT`

###Import data into Neo4j
I must've done something wrong in the above steps because from all the examples and YouTube videos I've seen, there is sample data you can map and play with.  That wasn't the case for me - my data set was blank.  Regardless, all I cared about was importing my newly acquired data :-)

Near the upper right of the Neo4j console you will see an `Import Data` button.  Click it, then point to one of your .csv files to upload it.  Continue until all are uploaded, and now you're ready to analyze the data!
