# Administrative/Prep

Pentest prep checklist
--------
Here's a quick list of things to consider - as well as questions to ask - before beginning a pentest.  This list will help keep both you and the client happy during the engagement.

* Did you get written approval from the client to actually *do* the pentest?

* Are your testing windows defined?

* Have you briefed the client on the fact that things will likely go down and/or break entirely (to set their expectations accordingly)?

* Is the client ok with bandwidth-intensive operations that may lock out accounts, such as brute-forcing accounts or brute-searching Web sites for content?

* If a system is successfully exploited, how does the client want you to handle next steps (i.e. *stop* what you're doing, or continue attempts to elevate privs and exfil data)?

* Has the client performed adequate backups of key systems in the case of systems going down and/or logs and databases filling up with junk data?

* If the pentest targets include AWS or other hosted infrastructure, did you go through the proper steps to get approval from those resources?

* Did you exchange emergency contact information with the client so you have a warm body to call when you bring down their Web site at 2 a.m. on a Saturday?


Pentesting w/no Internet
--------
* Listen to episodes #158, #164 and #170 of the [7 Minute Security](http://bit.ly/7minsec) podcast :-)
* Whitelist just the necessary http/https URLs to allow Kali to reach out to the 'net for OS updates, Metasploit definitions, and tools:
  * http.kali.org
  * dl.google.com
  * github.com
  * openvas.org
  * security.kali.org

Report writing
-------
### How to write a pentesting report (free template)
This [Peerlyst](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/how-to-write-a-penetration-testing-report-magda-chelly-ph-d) discusses some things that should be put into a pentest report, provides a sample outline and also some templates

### Serpico
I haven't used this [open source tool](https://github.com/SerpicoProject/Serpico) yet but have been hearing good things about how it can drastically cut down on report-writing time.  Check out their [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7DkaQyx5o) to get a feel for the tool's capabilities.
