# Recon
Tools to recon all the things.

## Important note
I've moved most of the command line tools for recon-related stuff [here](../../command_line/linux/scan_and_attack/index.md)

___

* [nmaptable](https://github.com/jgamblin/nmaptable/) will turn an nmap scan into a pretty D3.js HTML table.

* [SimplySecurity](https://github.com/SimplySecurity/SimplyDomain) is a "subdomain brute force focused on speed and data serialization"

* [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) finds domains, and finds 'em fast!
