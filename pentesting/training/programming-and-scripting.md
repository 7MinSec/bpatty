#Programming and Scripting
This is one area I'm looking to beef my skills up in, so here are some good resources:

##PowerShell
See my [PowerShell](../../cmdline/windows/powershell.md) page.

##Python
If you're looking to learn Python for hacking purposes, [this course](http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/learn-python-hacking.html?m=1) looks promising for ~$20-30.


I'm currently going through the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/2?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) intro to Python course and it's great.  They give you a compiler and everything else you need right in the Web interface.
