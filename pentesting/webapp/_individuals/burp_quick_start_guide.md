# Burp

## "Quick start"
I did a video demo of how to get up and going with Burp quickly in [episode #230](https://7ms.us/7ms-230-pentesting-owasp-juice-shop-part-1/) of the 7 Minute Security podcast.  It includes things like:

* Getting Burp installed
* Installing the SSL cert
* Installing FoxyProxy and proxying traffic through Burp
* Setting up a quick shell script to start Burp from the command line: 
  * `java -Xmx2g -jar burpsuite.jar`

* Installing helpful extensions from the BApp store :

 * CO2
 * CSRF Scanner
 * JS Beautifier
 * Retire.js
 * SQLiPy
 * Wsdler
