* I'm trying to HTTPS all the things.  If stuff is jacked please [let me know](https://github.com/braimee/bpatty/issues)
* Change log: RELOADED!
 * I nuked the other updates because there's like 1,000 of them and I'm pretty sure I'd have to update them all to a full HTTPS URL and I'd have to hire an intern to get that done, so yeah, no.
