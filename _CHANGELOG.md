## December 4, 2019
* Fixed the link to [BackyStuffyUppy](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/windows/backystuffyuppy.ps1) to, you know, actually link to the real script :-)
* Renamed [BackyStuffyUppy](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/windows/backystuffyuppy.ps1) so that it was spelled right (sigh)
* Made a new [nmap_eyewitness](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/linux/nmap_eyewitness.sh) script to automate some nmap scanning and Eyewitness-ing

## August 29, 2019
* Created a simple PowerShell script called [BackyStuffyUppy](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/windows/backystuffyuppy.ps1) that will easily backup folders of stuff from point A to point Z
* Updated the [kali_essentials.sh](https://bpatty.rocks/scripts/linux/kali_essentials.sh) script to include [brutescrape](https://github.com/cheetz/brutescrape) and [hash_combiner](https://github.com/hackern0v1c3/hash_combiner) and [honeydoc](https://github.com/jqreator)

## August 22, 2019
* I'm trying to HTTPS all the things.  If stuff is jacked please [let me know](https://github.com/braimee/bpatty/issues)
* Change log: RELOADED!
 * I nuked the other updates because there's like 1,000 of them and I'm pretty sure I'd have to update them all to a full HTTPS URL and I'd have to hire an intern to get that done, so yeah, no.
