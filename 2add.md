# Burp stuff
Create a folder called BurpProjectFiles

Create a new one on disk.  Under the BurpProjectFiles dir.  Make a new project in there called NonAdmin_Juice_Shop.burp.  

Take the defaults.

Setup options:

**Proxy**
Intercept is off.  Go to options, go to Intercept Server responses and check "Intercept server responses - YES".  Also "unhide hidden form fields."  

**Spider**
Options tab - spider engine...put number of threads to 5.

**Scanner**
In Options, check "URL path folders" and "URL path name".  Click "url to body" and "body to url" to see if posts can be sent as GETs.

Turn down number of threads to 5.  

Under Active Scanning optimization: THOROUGH>

In active scanning area, click SELECT ALL!
