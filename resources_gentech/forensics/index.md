Windows system forensics
-------
This page was just started 12/6/17 but will get cleaned up as I dig more into forensics.  I was mainly looking for a place to live-dump the great links I was finding as it relates to Windows forensics:

* This [SANS paper](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/quick-effective-windows-system-baselining-comparative-analysis-troubleshooting-inci-33884) is a good guide for baselining systems and then using that info to aid with incident response.

* SANS has great [posters](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/posters/dfir) that serve as quick reference guides to network and memory analysis.

* [SANS SIFT](https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-cli#installation) is the SANS Investigative Forensics Toolkit.

* [Caldera](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) is "an automated adversary emulation system that performs post-compromise adversarial behavior within enterprise networks."  This looks really cool, I'm anxious to test out in a lab environment once I have a good blue team defense in place.  Until then, I'm nervous to run it anywhere :-)

* The fine folks at SpectreOps have some [tools](https://specterops.io/resources/research-and-development) they've made to simulate adversaries.  When it comes to adversary detection, their [PowerForensics](https://github.com/Invoke-IR/PowerForensics) tool looks very cool.

* A guide to [picking apart malicious stuff from macros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A49S5xCnWsI)

* Good article on [basics of Windows incident response](https://jordanpotti.com/2017/01/20/basics-of-windows-incident-response/)

* A neat looking site for teaching [the art of memory analysis](https://www.memoryanalysis.net/amf), complete with memory dumps and practice quizes.  

* Google [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) is "an incident response framework focused on remote live forensics."

* Couple of nice videos on forensics from the folks at Black Hills Infosec: [Live Forensics & Memory Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEip9gl2MTA&t=3244s) and [Windows Live Forensics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcUMXxyYsnw).  But perhaps my fav resource is the [Dropbox link](http://www.tinyurl.com/504extra2) they shared that has all sorts of goodies, including an .exe that simulates a backdoor.
