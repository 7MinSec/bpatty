#Vulnerable Machines (and Apps)
Looking to sharpen those hacking skills in a safe/legal environment?  Kudos!  Here are some places to do just that:

##Damn Vulnerable Web Sockets
This [vulnerable Web application](https://github.com/interference-security/DVWS) "which works on web sockets for client-server communication."

##Hack and Defend Your Web Site
This is [the first course](http://course.hyperiongray.com/vcourse/) I ever took on Web app hacking and I *loved* it.  Good news for you is now it's free and covers setting up Burp, performing SQL injections, sqlmap, XSS and more!

##Hackazon
This is a [Rapid 7 project](https://github.com/rapid7/hackazon) project and is "a free, vulnerable test site that is an online storefront built with the same technologies used in todayâ€™s rich client and mobile applications."

##Vulnhub
[Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)'s goal is "...to provide materials that allows anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration."  There are tons of VMs to download and hack away on, and the difficulty ranges from "newb/novice" to "OMG!"

Some of my favorites include:

* [Droopy CTF](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/droopy-v02,143/)
* [FristiLeaks](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/fristileaks-13,133/)
* [Kevgir](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kevgir-1,137/)
* [Lord of the Root](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/lord-of-the-root-101,129/)
* [Milnet](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/milnet-1,148/)
* [Skydog](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/skydog-1,142/)
* [Sick0s 1.1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-11,132/)
* [Sick0s 1.2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-12,144/)
* [Simple](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sectalks-bne0x03-simple,141/)
* [Stapler](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/)

And in a bit of shameless self-promotion, I must plug my own VMs:

* [Billy Madison](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/billy-madison-11,161/)
* [Tommy Boy](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tommy-boy-1,157/)


##XSS Game
Is a [game by Google](https://xss-game.appspot.com/) to help you learn more about XSS!
